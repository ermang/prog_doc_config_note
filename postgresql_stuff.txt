then psql ENTER

#run below command to create a user with name 'root' and password 'root' that
is superuser

CREATE USER root SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'root';

-----

#this is from default pg_hba.conf file

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD                                                                  

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only                                                                                    
local   all             all                                     peer

replace it like this:

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD                                                                  

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only                                                                                    
local   all             all                                     password


systemctl stop/start postgresql.service
