Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster.

Node Components
    Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.
    - kubelet: An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.
    - kube-proxy: kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept

A workload is an application running on Kubernetes. Whether your workload is a single component or several that work together, on Kubernetes you run it inside a set of pods.

In Kubernetes, a Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster.

Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

The common format of a kubectl command is:

kubectl action resource

kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1

kubectl get deployments

    kubectl get => list resources
    kubectl describe => show detailed information about a resource
    kubectl logs => print the logs from a container in a pod
    kubectl exec => execute a command on a container in a pod

Management technique                Operates on             Recommended environment Learning curve
Imperative commands                 Live objects            Development projects    Lowest
Imperative object configuration     Individual files        Production projects     Moderate
Declarative object configuration    Directories of files    Production projects     Highest
